If your display	is your issue here are some common soloutions linked to display problems:			

If your screen will not turn on have you charged your phone? 
If you havent tried charging your phone ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOT OR SOMETHING?!

If you have tried charging your phone, is your charger a third party accessory?
If it is purchase an original one and try charging your device again

If this does not solve your problem your devices internal battery may be broken. Is your phones battery removable?
If it is get a replacement from your phone provider.
If it isnt removable, your pretty much fucked and need a new phone.
